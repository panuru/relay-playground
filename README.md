# Relay/GraphQL notebook/todo list

A small demo application using Relay and GraphQL.

Based on [Relay Starter Kit](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-starter-kit)

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Running

Start a local server:

```
npm start
```

## Developing

Any changes you make to files in the `js/` directory will cause the server to
automatically rebuild the app and refresh your browser.

If at any time you make changes to `data/schema.js`, stop the server,
regenerate `data/schema.json`, and restart the server:

```
npm run update-schema
npm start
```

Lint/code quality:

```
npm run lint
```

Code quality is run automatically on server start and code updates.

Unit tests:

```
npm test
```
